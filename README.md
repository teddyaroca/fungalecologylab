## Research Lab Website Design Template

This is a research lab website template that can be used by university students / professors to create a simple website for showing and displaying their labs / research. 

I built this for my brother years ago, and you can find his current site here: [University of Illinois Energy Transport Research Lab](http://etrl.mechanical.illinois.edu/)

You can find a live view of the template using the link below:

It was built using the libraries provided below:

- [Twitter Bootstrap (v2.3.1)](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
- [blueimp Gallery (v1.3.0)](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery)
